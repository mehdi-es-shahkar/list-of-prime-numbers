# list-of-prime-numbers
List of prime numbers whose product is equal to that integer (using a recursive function)

A recursive function is a function that uses the function itself in its body.

A prime number is a number that has no other divisors except itself and one.
 
Every integer is either prime or can be decomposed into a product of primes.
